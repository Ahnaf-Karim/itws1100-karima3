●	Include README.md documenting:
●	Database table structure for comments
●	How to test the comment system
●	My Answer:
1. Open the Lab10 webpage.
2. Scroll to the comment form.
3. Enter a name, email, and comment.
4. Submit the form.
5. A success or error message will appear without reloading the page.
6. The comment is inserted into the MariaDB database in the siteComments table.
●	Which sections used AI assistance
AI assistance was used for:
- db_connect.php
- submit_comment.php
- script.js (form validation + AJAX)
- comment form HTML structure
●	Any resources (besides AI) you consulted
- W3Schools PHP mysqli documentation
- jQuery documentation (jquery.com)
- Class notes & examples from ITWS1100
●	Include AI_PROMPTS.txt: Save 3-5 actual prompts you used with AI and brief notes on the results
●	First prompt: I just copied everything for the first part (The actual coding)  into copilot
●	Second: Went into Claude and did the same
●	Third: After comparing the two I submitted screenshots of what Claude said to do into copilot and asked it to fix everything so that it would work properly. I felt that copilot was useful and would save time because it has access to my VSCode, and can therefore edit my files directly. 
●	Fourth: Some of what the code was doing was wrong so just in case anything happened I pasted one of the old labs into an empty page then pasted it back into copilot and said, “Please redo the edits made to match the format of this file” and it worked. I think this helped me learn more about what Professor Plotka said about AI being a tool, not just the thing that does all of the work for you.
●	Fifth: Filter My work through ChatGPT as a final touch just to validate that everything is complete. A lot of this was me writing the “Skeleton” and then filtering everything through various AI. It turns out AI tools have pretty good synergy with each other (especially Copilot and ChatGPT)
